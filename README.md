8x8x8 3D Chess implementation in Unity with planar moves that has built in chess engine and multiplayer


Rules
If you were to set up pieces stacked on top of each other with line movement, you would need an incredible material advantage to force a checkmate, which would result in most games ending in a draw between players of equal skill, and games would take an extremely long time with 256 pieces on the board.

Lets take a look at rook. Lets look at what rook does. Rook controls 14 of 64 squares on the board roughly controling 21.88% of the board someone who have not studied any chess could figure out how to force a checkmate with but if you would take this line movement and apply it to 3d chess rook would control 21 of 512 tiles which is 4.10% of the board. 

Instead of increasing the number of pieces by a dimension, it is a more superior choice to increase their movement by a dimension, suddenly everything starts to work. You get theoretical endgames, openings, pawn structure, middlegame
